Welcome to NAVIGATOR!

NAVIGATOR is a game primarily about navigation. Your goal: efficiently navigate to a given final destination from an unknown initial one.
Behind this simple premise is layers of intriguing strategy. Since you are given no map, you must learn to remember routes. You must learn 
to efficiently use timetables. You must learn how to make the most of your time and money.

Please note that currently, the game is released under a **pre-alpha** version. Not all mechanics have been implemented yet, and existing 
mechanics have not been thoroughly tested. The current map is also extremely limited and minimal, and is by no means the intended 
experience for playing the game.

## Installation
To run this game, simply clone this repository and run the `main.py` file:
```
git clone https://github.com/Injng/navigator
cd navigator
python3 main.py
```

## Development
Contributions are highly welcome! To begin, first understand how the game works by reading the code. There is no formal documentation as of
now, but there are substantial comments in the code that will (hopefully) allow you to understand what is going on. Feel free to reach out
with a bug report or support question by opening an issue or PR.

## A note on the map
Players will quickly realize that the map is intended to be based on the real-life city of Beijing. This city was chosen for a number of
reasons, primarily:
- second largest public transit system in the world, allowing for more complex gameplay
- a language barrier adds another layer of exploration
- intermodal transport options offer features that in the future will allow for more layers of gameplay

Cities that are chosen are usually foreign, with a language other than English, along with a relatively large transit system. Cities that fit
these criteria include Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, Moscow, Madrid, and Paris, in no particular order.
