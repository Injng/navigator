Welcome to NAVIGATOR!

NAVIGATOR is a game primarily about navigation. Your goal: efficiently navigate to a given final destination from an unknown initial one.
Behind this simple premise is layers of intriguing strategy. Since you are given no map, you must learn to remember routes. You must learn 
to efficiently use timetables. You must learn how to make the most of your time and money.

It is important to note, however, that brute forcing is not your friend. Viewing objects, talking to locals, and experience will all offer
clues that will point you in the right direction.

There is one important rule that you should follow while playing this game. NO OUTSIDE RESOURCES. That means: no Google, no internet. This
game is designed to be able to be played only with the things it offers you.

Good luck!
